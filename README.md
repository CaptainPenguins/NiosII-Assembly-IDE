NiosII-Assembly-IDE
===================

An IDE specifically designed for the Nios II assembly language. 
Colors keywords, formats code, and checks syntax.

There are numerous C/C++ based Nios IDEs that are either individually developed, or based on existing suites like Eclipse. 
For example, Altera's Nios EDS is a suite based on C/C++ code and based off Eclipse. Unfortunately, many developers do need
direct access to the Assembly language, yet no similar software exist online that provide those "taken for granted"
features for Nios Assembly. 

This program fulfills the exact need to those programmers. I hope more people can contribute to its development so that it can
become a fully functional Nios simulator.
